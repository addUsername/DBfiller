# DBfiller

This repo is just a 'hello world'like project, technologies like github,
java.sql, mysql and OOP programmic paradigm will work together. I energetically 
discourage the use of this code for anything-but-fun propuses. 

It should be able to insert "random" rows to each table of a database, just that.
To acomplish you will need a database, url where de database is hosted and an user, 
this program just need an user with select, show and insert permissions.

At this point (v1.0) it does really well but only works for str and int types,
also further improvements on DBMS-compatibility should be implemented, for now
only works on mysql throught jdbc driver.

Have fun!
